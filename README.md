#Driver Drowsiness Detection System

To observe the drowsiness of Driver with OpenCV and Keras. 

Using OpenCV it is detecting the face of a driver and then delivers the image of the face to the classifier where it distinguishes whether the eyes are open or not. If eyes are close for more than 1 minute, clinking an alarm to wake up the driver. A minor experiment towards safety.
